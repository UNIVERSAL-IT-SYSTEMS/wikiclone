[http://www.digitalsurvival.us/stage7 Stage7] is an attempt to increase the usability of Gentoo and other Gentoo-based distributions by providing a way for users to automatically configure, build, and install their operating system. The project exists to be an aid to existing Gentoo users by speeding up the fresh install process so they can move on to more important matters in life.

Stage7 is built off the base of Quickstart and is currently a work in progress.
