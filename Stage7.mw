[http://www.digitalsurvival.us/stage7 Stage7] is an attempt to increase the usability of Gentoo and other Gentoo-based, POSIX compatible Linux distributions by providing a way for users to automatically configure, build, and install a new operating system quickly and easily. The project exists to be an aid to existing Gentoo users by speeding up the "fresh install process" enabling them to move on to more important matters in life.

Stage7 is built off the base of Andrew Gaffney's Quickstart progress and is currently a work in progress.
