=== Available Versions ===

KDE Frameworks 5 is the next generation of KDE libraries, that includes the necessary library and framework modules for KDE Plasma 5 and KDE Applications 5. It is Open Source, with its code being available for browsing through [http://quickgit.kde.org/ KDE QuickGit], and for public checkout. Gentoo, as a source based distro, has the ability to provide in addition to regular releases live ebuilds that checkout the code from the latest branch. Currently, we provide 9999 ebuilds from master branch.

{{Note|If you want to run a KDE Plasma 5 based desktop environment, you'll have to install KDE Plasma 5. This depends on KDE Frameworks 5, which only includes the necessary libraries and frameworks.}}

=== Keywording ===
Users with stable systems have to keyword the packages to proceed. We provide a {{Path|package.keywords}} file in ''kde'' overlay, which we'll have to symlink to our {{Path|package.keywords}} directory:

* KDE Frameworks 5.6:
: {{RootCmd|cd /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords|
  |ln -s /path/to/overlay/kde/Documentation/package.keywords/kde-frameworks-5.6.keywords}}

* KDE Frameworks master branch:
: {{RootCmd|cd /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords|
  |ln -s /path/to/overlay/kde/Documentation/package.keywords/kde-frameworks-live.keywords}}

=== Installation ===
In addition to the standard [[KDE#Packages|packages]], installation can be done by using sets:

* Installation of KDE Frameworks 5.6:
: {{Emerge|@kde-frameworks-5.6}}

* Installation of latest KDE Frameworks 5:
: {{Emerge|@kde-frameworks}}

* Installation of KDE Frameworks master branch:
