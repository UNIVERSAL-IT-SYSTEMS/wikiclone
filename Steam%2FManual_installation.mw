{{Note|As of writing, the only linux distro supported by steam upstream is ubuntu 12.04. Running on other systems, you are likely to run into occasional issues. See [[steam]] for more information on how to get steam working on gentoo.}}

{{Note|I recommend doing the following with a clean dedicated user account, to avoid steam (or the software it distributes) interfering with your other activities. If you do not want to restart or run two parallel X servers, you can use '''su''' to switch to the steam user, and  {{Package|x11-apps/xauth}} to give the steam user access to your running X server.}}

Use the latest steam installer tarball from [http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/archive/]. As of writing, this is `steam_1.0.0.45.tar.gz`.

{{Cmd|# download and extract the installer
|wget http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/archive/precise/steam_1.0.0.45.tar.gz
|tar xpvf steam_1.0.0.45.tar.gz steam/bootstraplinux_ubuntu12_32.tar.xz
|cd steam
|tar xpvf bootstraplinux_ubuntu12_32.tar.xz
|# run the installer
|./steam.sh}}

You can now launch steam with
{{Cmd|~/steam/steam.sh}}
