== Make GTK applications look like Qt 4 ones ==
There are two themes available which look the same under both toolkits (GTK/GNOME and Qt/KDE): "QtCurve" is provided via packages {{Package|gtk-engines-qtcurve}} and {{Package|x11-themes/qtcurve-qt4}}, "Oxygen" is part of KDE 4.x, its GTK counterpart is provided via package {{Package|x11-themes/oxygen-gtk}}. KDE themes can be configured via KDE's System Settings under "Appearance" in tab "Style". In order to configure the theme of GTK applications from within KDE's System Settings, install {{Package|kde-misc/kde-gtk-config}} to get a new tab "Gtk Config" under "Appearance".

== Fonts suggestions ==
If you click to view the menu and notice that there is nothing legible, you need to install some fonts. Some common choices are {{Package|media-fonts/corefonts}}, {{Package|media-fonts/ttf-bitstream-vera}} and {{Package|media-fonts/dejavu}}.
