== Make KDE start on boot ==
There are two ways to make KDE start on boot. The easiest way is by using the KDM, which is available at {{Package|kde-base/kdm}}. First we edit the Xorg Configuration file, so that ''DISPLAYMANAGER'' is set to ''kdm'':
{{File|/etc/conf.d/xdm||<pre>
# What display manager do you use ?  [ xdm | gdm | kdm | kdm-4.3 | gpe | entran$
# NOTE: If this is set in /etc/rc.conf, that setting will override this one.
#
# KDE-specific note:
# - If you are using kdeprefix go with "kdm-4.Y", e.g. "kdm-4.3".
#     You can find possible versions by looking at the directories in /usr/kde/.
# - Else, if you are using KDE 3 enter "kdm-3.5"
# - Else, if you are using KDE 4 enter "kdm" without a version
DISPLAYMANAGER="kdm"
</pre>}}

Next step is to add xdm to default runlevel:
{{RootCmd|rc-update add xdm default}}

== Make GTK applications look like Qt 4 ones ==
There are two themes available which look the same under both toolkits (GTK/Gnome and Qt/KDE): "QtCurve" is provided via packages {{Package|gtk-engines-qtcurve}} and {{Package|x11-themes/qtcurve-qt4}}, "Oxygen" is part of KDE 4.x, its GTK counterpart is provided via package {{Package|x11-themes/oxygen-gtk}}. KDE themes can be configured via KDE's System Settings under "Appearance" in tab "Style". In order to configure the theme of GTK applications from within KDE's System Settings, install {{Package|kde-misc/kde-gtk-config}} to get a new tab "Gtk Config" under "Appearance".

== Fonts suggestions ==
If you click to view the menu and notice that there is nothing legible, you need to install some fonts. Some common choices are {{Package|media-fonts/corefonts}}, {{Package|media-fonts/ttf-bitstream-vera}} and {{Package|media-fonts/dejavu}}.
