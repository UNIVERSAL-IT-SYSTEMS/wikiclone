= Scope =
Article aims to provide single article that explains basics of arch tester's work.

= Prerequisites =
This article assumes that readers are Arch Tester (AT) and that they know basics of work with shell, Gentoo and Portage. <br />

== stable enough system ==
System used for arch testing should be considered stable, this does not mean that all packages must be from stable tree though.

== make.conf ==
AT box should use mix of reasonably stable global CFLAGS (no -funsafe-optimizations, -funroll-loops etc).
Official docs, x86 AT FAQ (check links section) also suggests adding:
<pre>LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -Wl,--hash-style=gnu
FEATURES="test collision-protect"
</pre>
Setting '''test''' in ''FEATURES'' may be redundant if you plan to use tatt though.

= Build testing =

== tatt ==
This tool basically creates simple, automated test-suite that emerge package with various use-flag combination and also does set FEATURES="test" in one pass of it's work (this is why this should not be enabled globally).
Package will emerge multiple times, thus ccache is simply must-have here.

{{RootCmd |tatt -b 423987 
|output=<pre>
Bugnumber:  423987
Stabilization bug detected.
Jobname: gimps
Found the following package atom : =sci-mathematics/gimps-27.7-r1
=sci-mathematics/gimps-27.7-r1 already in /etc/portage/package.keywords/archtest
WARNING: Will overwrite gimps-useflags.sh
No stable rdeps for gimps
WARNING: Will overwrite gimps-cleanup.sh
WARNING: Will overwrite gimps-success.sh
Success Report script written to gimps-success.sh
WARNING: Will overwrite gimps-commit.sh
Commit script written to gimps-commit.sh
</pre>}}
This command will generate 4 scripts in your current directory:
{{Cmd |ls
|output= gimps-cleanup.sh  gimps-commit.sh  gimps-success.sh  gimps-useflags.sh }}
{{RootCmd | sh gimps-useflags.sh}}
<pkg>-useflags.sh script will start batch emerge of package with different USE flags to make sure everything is ok.
Test results are written to {{Path|./<pkg>.report}}.
{{RootCmd | sh gimps-cleanup.sh}}
<pkg>-cleanup.sh will remove keyword from {{Path|/etc/portage/package.keywords/archtest}}, please note that package.keywords is a directory, if you have in this path file, it will not work. Fix is intuitive, backup your package.keywords, create directory with this name instead and place your backup in it.
{{RootCmd | sh gimps-commit.sh.sh}}
{{RootCmd | sh gimps-success.sh}}
