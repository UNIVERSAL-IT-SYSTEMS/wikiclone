{{Warning|X session and UI integration still in development.<ref name=nbgrtzu>{{Bug|522854}}</ref>}}

There is a nice and neat gtK+-{2,3}.0/QT4 UI for dhcpcd {{Package|net-misc/dhcpcd-ui}} to get a sane user interface via a systray icon without any crap *kit cruft. Although the main portage tree ebuild is very out dated, there is<ref name=nbgrtzu>{{Bug|522854}}</ref> open for a newer versioned/live ebuild. The attached ebuild may not be up to date so check out this [https://github.com/tokiclover/bar-overlay/tree/master/net-misc/dhcpcd-ui overlay] for an up to date ebuild. 

dhcpcd daemon should be running in master mode and not per interface. So don't use net.*, as explained in the previous sections, to ensure that dhcpcd is passed the -M flag which *might* allow it to work.

Also, >=net-misc/dhcpcd-6.4.4 is required with unprivileged socket ''or'' you need to be able to write to dhcpcd's socket. In newer versions you can say which group has ''read/write'' (RW) access to it in dhcpcd.conf (checkout the previous sections or dhcpcd.conf(5).) The default config has a commented out section which allows wheel group RW access. You should enable this and ensure your user is in the wheel group. If not, you'll need to add it and log out and then log in to get the effects of the change.

The following line is enough to get the UI started in a simple X session without a display manager.

{{File|~/.xinitrc||<pre>...
dhcpcd-gtk >/dev/null 2>&1 &
...</pre>}}

That output redirection will avoid geting SSID/IP and other network informations displayed in the parrent shell.

Or else, checkout out the documentation of your Desktop Environment for DE integration.
