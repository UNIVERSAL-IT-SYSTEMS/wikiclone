This page is a place-holder for packages where upstream went missing.

= For users =

If you reached this page when opening the HOMEPAGE of a package this means that at some point upstream went missing for that package. You should find the original upstream URL either as another link in the HOMEPAGE or commented out in the ebuild.

Developers usually try to figure out whether upstream really vanished or the homepage just got moved. But they can miss some things too, servers can get online again, etc.
If you happen to know where upstream went or if the original HOMEPAGE is online again, please open a bug report at https://bugs.gentoo.org/ and tell the developers about it!

Missing upstream does not automatically lead to the removal of a package. But if bugs are piling up for a package where upstream is missing the developers may decide to remove the package rather than fixing bugs.

= For developers =

Please use this page as the first URL in HOMEPAGE if upstream went missing and no new location can be found.
Furthermore you can change SRC_URI to point to the Gentoo mirrors instead of invalid upstream. Please keep the old SRC_URI either as a second URL as well or comment it out.
