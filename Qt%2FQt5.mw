This short tutorial explains how to install Qt 5.1.0 libs and Qt Creator 2.8 in order to develop applications with it.

== Qt5 ==
Use [[layman]] to add the ''qt'' repository:
{{RootCmd|layman -a qt}}
Refer to the [[Layman]] article if you need instructions on how to install and configure layman.

There are two sets that combined provide entirety of the Qt5 toolkit. These are ''@qt5-essentials'' and ''@qt5-addons''. For the sake of completeness both are assumed to be needed in this article.
{{Emerge|@qt5-essentials @qt5-addons}}

These packages are not marked as stable so you'll need to unmask them. The easiest way to do this is to initially emerge these sets with the ''--autounmask-write'' argument. See the [[Unmasking a package]] [[:Category:Knowledge Base|Knowledge Base]] article for more information on how to do so.

== QtCreator ==
The Qt development IDE can be installed easily with:
{{Emerge|dev-qt/qt-creator}}
