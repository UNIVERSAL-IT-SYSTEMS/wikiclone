This short tutorial explains how to install Qt 5.1.0 libs and Qt Creator 2.8 in order to develop applications with it.

Although there is a layman overlay I found the overlay method too complex since it requires many unmasks and dependency fiddling. With this method you install all files into two new folders. No other changes are made to your system. Later you can simply delete them and there will be no traces left, beside user configuration in your home folder. You don't have to unmask 10+ files and edit several files and possibly break something else on your machine.

== Installation ==
Download the [http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/5.1/5.1.0/single/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.1.0.tar.gz Qt 5.1.0 sources] and the [http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qtcreator/2.8/2.8.0/qt-creator-2.8.0-src.tar.gz Qt Creator 2.8.0 sources]. In case you want another version, go to https://qt-project.org/downloads and look for '''tar.gz''' sources inside the paragraph below the highlighted links.

=== All-in-one copy and paste command ===
Run this in the folder where both archives are located:
{{RootCmd|tar xvf qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.1.0.tar.gz && cd qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.1.0 && ./configure && make && make install && echo -e 'PATH{{=}}/usr/local/Qt-5.1.0/bin:$PATH\nexport PATH' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc && cd .. && tar xvf qt-creator-2.8.0-src.tar.gz && cd qt-creator-2.8.0-src && qmake -r && make && mkdir /usr/local/QtCreator-2.8.0 && make install INSTALL_ROOT{{=}}/usr/local/QtCreator-2.8.0}}

=== Step by step. (The same as above) ===
==== Qt libs ====
Extract archive:
{{Cmd|tar xvf qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.1.0.tar.gz}}
Change into extracted directory:
{{Cmd|cd qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.1.0}}
Configure:
{{Cmd|./configure}}
Compile:
{{Cmd|make}}
Install:
{{RootCmd|make install}}
The default install folder is ''/usr/local/Qt-5.1.0''.
Add new Qt5 libs to PATH so that other programs (i.e. the following compilation of qt creator) use the new version:
{{Cmd|echo -e 'PATH{{=}}/usr/local/Qt-5.1.0/bin:$PATH\nexport PATH' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc}}

==== Qt Creator ====
Extract archive:
{{Cmd|tar xvf qt-creator-2.8.0-src.tar.gz}}
Change into extracted directory:
{{Cmd|cd qt-creator-2.8.0-src}}
Configure:
{{Cmd|qmake -r}}
Compile:
{{Cmd|make}}
Create folder for Qt Creator installation:
{{RootCmd|mkdir /usr/local/QtCreator-2.8.0}}
Install:
{{RootCmd|make install INSTALL_ROOT{{=}}/usr/local/QtCreator-2.8.0}}

The Qt Creator binary is located at ''/usr/local/QtCreator-2.8.0/bin/qtcreator''

== Configuration ==
=== Add Qt5 to Qt Creator ===
In Qt Creator
* go to: '''Tools''' -> '''Options''' -> '''Build&Run''' -> '''Qt Versions'''. Click '''Add''' on the right. Navigate to ''/usr/local/Qt-5.1.0/bin'' and choose ''qmake''.
* go to: '''Tools''' -> '''Options''' -> '''Build&Run''' -> '''Kits'''. Select your active Kit, probably ''Desktop (default)'' and set '''Qt version''' to your new Qt version.
Qt Creator is now configured to use Qt5.

=== Optional: Add Qt Creator 2.8. to the KDE menu. ===
Start '''kmenuedit'''. Click on '''Development''', click on '''New Item''', enter ''Qt Creator 2.8.0'' [or whatever you want the entry to be named]. In '''command''' enter ''/usr/local/QtCreator-2.8.0/bin/qtcreator'', chose an icon by clicking on the square button. Press OK and you are done.
