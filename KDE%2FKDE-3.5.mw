= KDE 3.5 =

The maintainance of KDE 3 now takes place in the [http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/kde-sunset.git;a=summary kde-sunset] overlay (available in layman). All KDE 3 core and miscellaneous packages have been moved there. Keep in mind that this overlay is user-maintained only, and current KDE team members have no responsibility about its status. If you are interested in co-maintaining it, you can file a bug to Overlays Team (Product: Gentoo Infrastructure, Component: Gentoo Overlays) asking for commit access. If you want to report a bug about this overlay, please don't file a bug in Gentoo's Bugzilla. Instead, use the [http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-desktop/ gentoo-desktop] mailing list. Instructions on how to subscribe can be found [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/lists.xml here] . 

Please see the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/userguide.xml Gentoo Overlays Users's Guide] to get all information on how to use overlays.
