== Installing snapshots ==
During testing phases KDE upstream provides snapshots taken from the git source repositories. Beta and Release Candidate KDE releases are following the snapshot model below (where x is the version number of the ''previous'' release, i.e. 13 for KDE SC 4.14 Beta):

{| class="wikitable"
! style="background: #31206C; color: white; white-space: nowrap;" | KDE SC version
! style="background: #31206C; color: white; white-space: nowrap;" | Ebuilds version
|-
|Beta 1
|4.x.80
|-
|Beta 2
|4.x.90
|-
|Beta 3
|4.x.95
|-
|Release Candidate 1
|4.x.97
|}

== Installing live ebuilds ==
KDE SC is Open Source, with its code being available for browsing through [http://quickgit.kde.org/ KDE QuickGit], and for public checkout. Gentoo, as a source based distro, has the ability to provide live ebuilds that checkout the code from the latest branch. Currently, we provide 4.14.49.9999 ebuilds from 4.14 branch.

=== Unmasking ===
Users with stable systems have to keyword the packages to proceed. We provide a {{Path|package.keywords}} file in ''kde'' overlay, which we'll have to symlink to our {{Path|package.keywords}} directory:

* KDE SC 4.14 branch:
: {{RootCmd|cd /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords|
  |ln -s /path/to/overlay/kde/Documentation/package.keywords/kde-4.14.49.9999.keywords}}

=== Installation ===
In addition to the standard [[KDE#Packages|packages]], installation can be done by using sets:

* Installation of KDE SC 4.14 branch:
: {{Emerge|@kde-4.14}}
