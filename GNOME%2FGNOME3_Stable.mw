== This is a list of things that are blocking the stabilization of GNOME 3. ==

==== Regressions ====

* a11y support is incomplete (TODO: add list of things missing)
:* Even GDM-3 (with gnome-shell) isn't accessible
* No proper replacement for the concept of the "Desktop" (Finding & Reminding)
* Printing doesn't support network printers properly (buggy/incomplete)
:* Regression over: system-config-printer-gnome 
* Rhythmbox is still somewhat unstable (at least it plays music now thoughâ€¦)
:* Regression over: rhythmbox-0.13, etc
* Totem video playback is too CPU-intensive on ATI (stabilize totem-3.0?) 
:* Regression over: anything using xv for video output
* gnome-games is useless. Upstream needs to stop rewriting games from scratch every 3 months. (don't stabilize it?)
:* seed is a dead project, all JS games are now being rewritten (AGAIN) in Vala.
:* Regression over: older gnome-games 
* dconf-editor needs to stop sucking so hard (widgets keep resizing randomly, making it unusable)
:* Regression over: gconf-editor
* GTK+3 is still a buggy PoS (eg: input)
:* Regression over: GTK+2
* pygobject is still a buggy PoS (introspection)
:* Regression over: traditional python bindings
* gstreamer-properties (from gnome-media) should set both gconf and gsettings keys
:* gconfaudiosink -> gsettingsaudiosink/autoaudiosink
* sound-juicer has no maintainer, and no 3.0 release
[[Category:GNOME]]
====  Bugs: ==== 

* We still don't know how to make gnome-online-accounts work for anything except Google
:* Flickr integration in backgrounds capplet doesn't work
:* Facebook integration exists, but no API key
* Empathy's history window makes too many dbus calls, sends too much data over dbus, and becomes unusably slow
* Epiphany 3.2 sucks, 3.4 is much better
*
