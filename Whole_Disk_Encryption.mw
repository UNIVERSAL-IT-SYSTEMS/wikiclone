This guide will attempt to explain how to use DM-Crypt with LUKS to perform whole disk encryption. This guide is a major work in progress, it's contents should be treated with care. In addition to standard configuration of DM-Crypt and LUKS this guide will also explain how to use TPM based key storage. In time, I hope to add additional documentation on using Loop-AES.

Note: This was designed as a guide to migrate an existing system over to Encrypted Root, but you should be able to use it to install to an encrypted filesystem as well. You may need to tweak things a bit, such as the TPM setup.

== Getting Started ==
=== [[Whole_Disk_Encryption/Overview|Overview]] ===
An overview of the process that will be used in this guide.
=== [[Whole_Disk_Encryption/SSD|Solid State Disks]] ===
Concerns pertaining to Solid State Hard Drives.
=== [[Whole_Disk_Encryption/TPM|Trusted Platform Module]] ===
What is a TPM, and arguments for/against using it.
== Preparation ==
=== [[Whole_Disk_Encryption/Secure_Erase|Securely Erase the Hard Drive]] ===
To start with, we need to prepare the hard drive by securely erasing it and then filling it with pseudorandom data.
== Kernel Configuration ==
=== [[Whole_Disk_Encryption/Kernel_Basic|Basic Kernel Requirements]] ===
=== [[Whole_Disk_Encryption/Kernel_TPM|TPM Kernel Requirements]] ===
== Userspace Tools ==
