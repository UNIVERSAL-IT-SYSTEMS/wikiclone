''python-r1'' is a new eclass for Python packages. The major goal is to provide a simpler (and more powerful at the same time) replacement for the old ''python.eclass'' which people have significant trouble maintaining.

The ''-r1'' eclass branch consists of the following eclasses:
* python-r1 — general-use Python package eclass,
* distutils-r1 — distutils build system wrapper.

== Information for users ==

=== Choice of Python implementations ===
The main difference for users is the way that Python implementations for packages being built are selected.

In python.eclass, the implementations to be built can be selected using custom ''USE_PYTHON'' variable in ''make.conf''. If unset, the implementation currently selected using ''eselect python'' is used.

In python-r1 (and python-distutils-ng) the implementation is controlled using USE_EXPAND variable ''PYTHON_TARGETS''. If unset, the Gentoo-wide default is used (currently it is Python 2.7).

The enabled implementation can be set like the following:
{{Code|Example PYTHON_TARGETS setup in make.conf|<pre>
PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7 python3_2"
</pre>}}

== Information for ebuild developers ==

=== Uses for eclasses ===

The ''distutils-r1'' eclass should be used:
* in Python packages which use the distutils build system,
* in Python packages which use another build system which works similarly to distutils (respects EPYTHON, installs scripts with correct shebang).

The ''python-r1'' eclass should be used:
* in packages with optional Python parts,
* in Python packages which use a build system for which distutils-r1 is not suitable.

The main features of the eclasses are listed in the following table:
