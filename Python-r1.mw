{{Lowercase title}}

''python-r1'' is a new eclass for Python packages. The major goal is to provide a simpler (and more powerful at the same time) replacement for the old ''python.eclass'' which people have significant trouble maintaining.

The ''-r1'' eclass branch consists of the following eclasses:
* python-r1 — general-use Python package eclass,
* distutils-r1 — distutils build system wrapper.
