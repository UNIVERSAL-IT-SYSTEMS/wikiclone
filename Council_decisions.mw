This page intends to provide a quick summary of all decisions which were done by the Council. It should only list general directions and avoid unnecessary details; it should also avoid repeating what is described in the PMS.

== Currently approved EAPIs ==

* ebuilds: EAPI 4 ([http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/meeting-logs/20110201-summary.txt 02/2011 meeting])
* profiles: EAPI 1 ([http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/meeting-logs/20111011-summary.txt 10/2011 meeting])

== Decisions ==

* Systems with separate /usr should be supported. However, users shouldn't be constrained from using software which doesn't support that. -- [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/meeting-logs/20120403-summary.txt 04/2012 meeting]
* The ChangeLog and commit messages do not need to be the same. However, both messages should be valid. -- [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/meeting-logs/20111108-summary.txt 11/2011 meeting]
* When removing functions or changing API of an eclass, developers should ensure that it doesn't break any ebuilds in the tree and send a notice to gentoo-dev 30 days in advance. -- [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/meeting-logs/20111108-summary.txt 11/2011 meeting]

* Old-style virtuals are not allowed in the tree. -- [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/meeting-logs/20110608-summary.txt 06/2011 meeting]
