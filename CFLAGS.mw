'''The CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS variables are passed on to the compiler and contains architecture information, compiler optimizations and logging- and failure levels.'''

The CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS variables content is passed on to each invocation of '''cc''' (the C compiler, usually '''gcc''') or '''c++''' (the C++ compiler, usually '''g++''') respectively during compile and build phases of software. Within Gentoo, this variable is set in /etc/make.conf so that each compile job invoked by the package manager uses these CFLAGS entries.

{{File|/etc/make.conf||<pre>CFLAGS="-march=native -O2 -pipe"
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"</pre>}}
