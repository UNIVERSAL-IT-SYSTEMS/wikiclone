This page is intended to link or to write down Gnome team policies about its own packages or how packages using Gnome team packages as dependencies should handle some particular aspects.

== gtk-doc ==

gtk-doc is the framework for documentating libraries for developer audience. It provides tools to extract, compile and install documentation from the source code of the library directly. In gentoo, this used to be handled by USE=doc for all packages using gnome2.eclass however the behavior was not fit to what users expected.
After much discussion gnome team came to the following conclusions:
* '''gtk-doc must always be installed'''. gtk-doc is part of the package as distributed by upstream (pre-built), hence it costs no extra CPU time, no extra dependencies and has relatively low disk space requirements. Corollary, there is no need to rebuild documentation, so just pass --disable-gtk-doc to configure.
* '''gtk-doc must be installed in /usr/share/gtk-doc'''. gtk-doc is a framework for documentation, just like any other framework, files targeted for it must be usually be installed in a defined place to be any useful (such as in devhelp). Also, until there is a better solution, this allows users to easily avoid any gtk-doc documentation if they have no use for it by using install-mask feature.
* '''All packages using gtk-doc must DEPEND on gtk-doc-am'''. This package provides macros for autoreconf and tools to relink installed documentation to local resources instead of http://library.gnome.org.
