== Firefox ==

Before installing the plug-in with Firefox (any general version should generally work), be sure to have the dependencies installed:

{{Emerge|media-libs/alsa-lib x11-libs/libXext x11-libs/libXxf86dga x11-libs/libXxf86vm}}

Then go to http://www.quakelive.com and install the plug-in as normal.

== Chrome/Chromium ==

The plug-in is not yet compatible with Chromium even if the file is put in the proper directory with proper permissions. Currently it crashes Chrome's plugin process.
