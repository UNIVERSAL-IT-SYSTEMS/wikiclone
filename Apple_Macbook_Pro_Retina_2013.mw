== Models ==
There are 3 models overall: 13", 15"-intel-only, 15"-nvidia+intel

== Installation Steps ==
The System Rescue CD 4 works fine, pending a caveat due the SSD triggering a strange behaviour with SATA.

Setting the queue_size to 1 workarounds it:

== Bootloader ==

Refind which is a fork of Refit and is being actively development and maintained. For installation see [http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html#installsh this link].

== Kernel ==

Configure your kernel as normal, but add the following options for EFI Stub:

Processor type and features  --->
    [*] EFI runtime service support 
    [*]   EFI stub support

Processor type and features  --->
    [*] Built-in kernel command line
    (root=/dev/sda4)

Make sure the root= line on your kernel command line configuration is correct. More details about Kernel configuration for EFI stub are here: [[ EFI stub kernel ]]

This assumes you do not need an initramfs. I do not use one. If you do, the EFI stub method may not be the easiest method. But it can still be done, refer to the [[ EFI_stub_kernel ]] page.

Also, add the following Kernel options for driver support:

These options are in addition to the standard options you would select for Intel based PC's

Drivers, Input, Generic Input, Mouse:
 CONFIG_MOUSE_BCM5974=y (For trackpad support)

Drivers, Hardware monitoring
 CONFIG_SENSORS_APPLESMC (Motion, light sensor, kbd backlight)

Drivers, Graphics Support:
 CONFIG_DRM_I915=y (Intel 8xx/9xx/HD Graphics)

Drivers, Graphics, Backlight, Lowlevel Backlight:
 CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_APPLE=y (screen backlight)

Drivers, X86 Platform Specific
 CONFIG_APPLE_GMUX=y

Ensure the following options are NOT set (required for proper Broadcom wireless):
 CONFIG_MAC80211=n (Networking support, Wireless)
 CONFIG_B43=n (Drivers, Network Device, Wireless LAN)
 CONFIG_BRCMFMAC=n (Drivers, Network device, Wireless LAN)
 CONFIG_SSB=n (Drivers, Sonics Silicon Backplane)

Drivers, Multimedia support, Media USB
 CONFIG_USB_VIDEO_CLASS=m (Webcam)

Drivers, Sound, ALSA, PCI:
 CONFIG_SND_HDA_INTEL=m (Should be built as a module to set the option, see below)
 CONFIG_SND_HDA_CODEC_HDMI=m
 CONFIG_SND_HDA_CODEC_CIRRUS=m

The normal make install works since refind would pick up your kernel directly.
